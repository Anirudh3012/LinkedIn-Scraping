# LinkedIn-Scraping
Web scraping for LinkedIn profiles by taking the designation and location from the user and storing the collected data in an Excel sheet
Contains - Name, Designation, Company, Education, Location and the profile URl
I do not recommmend you to use this as a way to collect data as this is against the privacy terms and conditions of LinkedIn but you can use this for a test or to modify
